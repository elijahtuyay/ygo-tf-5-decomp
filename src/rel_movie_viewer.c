/*
 * rel_movie_viewer.prx — reconstructed code (matching decompilation)
 *
 * Compiler:     Metrowerks CodeWarrior for PSP — MWCC 1.3 SP7 (mwccpsp_3.0.1_219)
 * Flags:        -O4,s -sdatathreshold 0   (SIZE, not ,p — see docs/09)
 * Verification: local build with wibo + mwccpsp_3.0.1_219 (see docs/03-tools.md
 *               "local matching" section) — compare with
 *               `mips-linux-gnu-objdump -dr` against asm/rel_movie_viewer/text.s,
 *               treating any word with a matching relocation (HI16/LO16/26,
 *               same symbol) on both sides as equal regardless of its baked
 *               immediate. Only functions marked "MATCH 100%" below have been
 *               confirmed this way; 15/16 functions in this file currently are.
 *
 * IMPORTS ARE NAMED (docs/nids/README.md). Every call out of this module is
 * now a resolved name rather than a stub address, and those names are shared
 * with all 27 other modules: ehsys_B4471B5E (the module-registration call that
 * opens every module), ehsys_memset, ehsys_strcpy, ehsys_strcat,
 * ehsys_strlen, and sceIoDopen/sceIoDread/sceIoDclose — which confirm that
 * func_000006BC really is a directory walk. Six of these names also appear in
 * src/rel_html_view.c, spelled identically.
 *
 * Conventions (see docs/09-first-match.md):
 *  - global game-state variables are `volatile` and are accessed via a local
 *    pointer to reproduce the original codegen (value reload, use of $s0);
 *  - names `func_XXXXXXXX` / `D_XXXXXXXX` = placeholders (address), to be renamed
 *    as their purpose becomes clear.
 *  - whether a state-blob field is a fresh named extern (`D_0009DB04`, ...) or
 *    `offset(basePointer)` off a `volatile T *p = &D_0009DB00;` depends on
 *    whether the ORIGINAL reuses one register across multiple fields of the
 *    blob (offset form) or recomputes a fresh %hi/%lo per field (separate
 *    extern form) — this must be checked per function against the target asm,
 *    it is not a blanket rule (func_00000138 does NOT share a register between
 *    D_0009DB00 and D_0009DB04; func_00000034/func_000001C8/func_00000470/
 *    func_00000540/func_000005C8/func_000006BC DO share one across several
 *    fields).
 *
 * Functions below `func_00000184` without a "MATCH 100%" tag are DRAFTS: they
 * compile and their instruction COUNT/logic is right (each has been narrowed
 * to the closest word-count achievable and its remaining gap root-caused —
 * see its own comment), but a handful of instructions differ from the
 * target, almost always one of these confirmed-uncontrollable-from-portable-C
 * MWCC codegen choices:
 *   - branch polarity in an if/else-if chain (`beq`-to-handler vs
 *     `bne`-skip), and whether a loop test gets rotated to the bottom
 *     without duplication or WITH a duplicated pre-test — both are
 *     sometimes forceable with an explicit `goto`-based rewrite that
 *     mirrors the target's exact block layout (worked for func_00000540,
 *     func_000007C8's copy loop, and the branch shapes in func_000001C8/
 *     func_000005C8/func_000006BC), sometimes not (func_00000034's loop
 *     test). When `goto` will not do it, try a single-case `switch`: it is
 *     NOT equivalent to `if` here. MWCC compiles a `switch` by branching
 *     INTO the case body (`beql`, with a body instruction scheduled in the
 *     delay slot) and giving the fall-through path its own `b` to the
 *     epilogue, whereas every `if`/`goto` phrasing of the same test folds
 *     the two into a single `bnel`-skip that is one word shorter. This is
 *     what matched func_00000470's tail and func_00000034's dispatch;
 *   - [RESOLVED — was wrong] the Allegrex `min`/`max` instructions were
 *     recorded here as an unreliable compiler fold of a `(x < 0) ? 0 : x`
 *     clamp. They are not a fold at all: MWCC NEVER emits them from portable
 *     C (verified across every `?:`/`if` phrasing, every -O level, and all 11
 *     installed builds). They are the compiler intrinsics
 *     `__builtin_allegrex_max` / `__builtin_allegrex_min`, and the original
 *     source called them directly. Argument order is
 *     `__builtin_allegrex_max(rs, rt)` -> `max rd, rs, rt`, so the target's
 *     `max $v1, $zero, $v1` is `__builtin_allegrex_max(0, x)`.
 *     Beware when probing for these: `mips-linux-gnu-objdump` does not know
 *     the Allegrex opcodes and prints them as a bare `.word`, so a successful
 *     intrinsic call looks like a failure unless you check the encoding
 *     (`max` = funct 0x2C, `min` = 0x2D). The full intrinsic list is
 *     recoverable with `strings tools/mwccpsp_3.0.1_219/mwccpsp.exe |
 *     grep __builtin_allegrex` — bitrev, clz/clo, ctz/cto, ext/ins, rotl/rotr,
 *     seb/seh, wsbh/wsbw, sqrt_s, and the float round/floor/ceil/trunc.
 *     Used by func_00000470; func_00000294 needs both;
 *   - whether it caches a global's address in a saved register for reuse
 *     across many straight-line statements (target sometimes does; this
 *     compiler was confirmed by isolated experiment to always
 *     re-materialize a fresh `lui/addiu` per access instead, regardless of
 *     pointer/struct form — func_00000294, and the `state + 0x6408/0x6534`
 *     case in func_000006BC/func_000005C8);
 * Treat DRAFTs as very-close NONMATCHING, not as verified.
 *
 * CAUTION on "the compiler just allocates registers differently" diagnoses:
 * func_000007C8 was documented as exactly that (`$a0` vs `$a1` for the
 * copy-loop pointer) and it was NOT — the leading parameter had been typed as
 * unused when the target actually forwards it into ehsys_CABEA834, so $a0 was
 * never free to begin with. Fixing the dataflow matched the function outright.
 * An "unused" leading parameter that the target never writes before a call is
 * a strong hint that the parameter is being passed straight through.
 *
 * Layout notes discovered while drafting (see asm/rel_movie_viewer/text.s):
 *  - D_0009DB00 is the start of a much larger state blob. func_00000138
 *    zero-fills it with size 0x653C via ehsys_memset(&D_0009DB00, 0, 0x653C),
 *    which is exactly (last known field 0x6538) + 4 — i.e. 0x653C is very
 *    likely the blob's real size.
 *  - D_000A3F0C (referenced directly elsewhere via its own %hi/%lo symbol)
 *    is exactly D_0009DB00 + 0x640C: the two names denote adjacent globals
 *    in the SAME data blob, not unrelated objects.
 *  - Fields at D_0009DB00+0x6408 and +0x6530 are read both via a register
 *    holding &D_0009DB00 (spimdisasm resolves these to D_0009DB00 in the
 *    asm) and via raw absolute immediates (0xA3F08 / 0xA4030, left
 *    unresolved by spimdisasm because no relocation entry pointed at the
 *    middle of the blob) — same memory, two addressing idioms.
 *  - D_0009DB00+0x0008 up to +0x6408 looks like an array of 0x100-byte
 *    records (100 of them: 100*0x100+8 = 0x6408), indexed via
 *    `(index << 8) + 8`; +0x6408 itself is used as a slot counter/index
 *    compared against 0x64 (100).

 * however it is written, goto chains included — gets an inverted branch with
 * the body inline, which is 2 words shorter and cannot be talked out of it.

 *
 * ---- 2026-08-17 investigation. SUPERSEDES the earlier "store-elimination
 * bug" theory recorded here, which did not hold up. Read this before
 * retrying so the dead ends are not walked again: ----
 *
 * The whole 13-word gap is address re-materialisation: the target keeps
 * &D_000A3F0C in $s0 and the record base ($s0 + 0x4C) in $s1 for the entire
 * function, while this version re-derives a lui/addiu pair per access
 * (lui=32 vs the target's 5).
 *
 * ROOT CAUSE. It is not a bug and not flag-specific. At -O2 and above MWCC
 * enables "copy and expression propagation" (see `mwccpsp.exe -help`, -opt
 * level=2), which propagates &D_000A3F0C as a compile-time constant into all
 * 31 use sites and re-materialises it at each one instead of keeping it live
 * in a saved register. There is no sub-option to disable propagation alone —
 * -opt exposes only `level=` and `[no]intrinsics` — so no flag fixes this
 * without regressing the 15 functions that already match.
 *
 * MEASURED, so it need not be re-derived (struct model, all stores correct):
 *  - -O4,s / -O4,p / -O4 / -O3,s : 128 words, lui=31 — IDENTICAL. The flag
 *    makes no difference to this function at all.
 *  - -O2,s : 131 words, lui=31.
 *  - -O1,s : 143 words, lui=5 — the target's cached-base shape appears, but
 *    the rest of the function is then unoptimised.
 *  - all 11 installed mwccpsp builds (121..219) at -O4,s : 128 words, lui=31.
 *    The compiler build is not the variable.
 *  - `register` on the pointers, and -inline on/all/auto/level=8/deferred:
 *    no effect. Forcing the body inline just re-exposes the constant and it
 *    folds again.
 *
 * DISPROVEN — the previous note claimed an mwccpsp store-elimination bug
 * under -O4,p that silently dropped four byte stores once two pointers shared
 * a base, and claimed a struct form reached 107 words / lui=5. Neither
 * reproduces with the layout used here: under BOTH flags all 13 sb and 11 sh
 * are emitted, and no source shape tried reached lui=5 at -O2+. If the old
 * result was real it depended on some detail of that session's struct
 * layout, not on the flag.
 *
 * THE DIAGNOSTIC THAT LOCATED IT. Written as a helper taking the blob as a
 * parameter — `void init(Cfg *cfg)` — the identical body compiles to 103
 * words with lui=4, all 13 sb / 11 sh, and a prologue matching the target
 * exactly, including `addiu <rec>, <cfg>, 0x4C` scheduled into the
 * ehsys_memset delay slot. A pointer PARAMETER cannot be re-materialised, so
 * the base stays in a saved register. The target sits symmetrically between
 * the two forms: direct = 129 (+13), parameter = 103 (-13), target = 116.
 * This is diagnostic only — the target takes no arguments, so the parameter
 * form is not itself a candidate.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL OPEN. A no-argument source shape that denies MWCC the
 * constant while still emitting %hi/%lo of D_000A3F0C. Worth noting that the
 * target mixes two addressing modes in one function: &D_000A3F0C is a
 * relocated symbol reference (%hi/%lo), while D_0009DB00, D_000A3F08 and
 * D_000A4030 are raw absolute (`lui $v0, 0xA` / `lw $v0, -0x2500($v0)`).
 * That split may be a clue about how the original source named these.
 *
 * DECOMP-PERMUTER, tried and exhausted (2026-08-17). 337,244 iterations at
 * -j4 over 30 minutes. Best diff score 3875, down from the base 6830, but
 * nowhere near 0. Its best candidate reaches 123 words (vs this version's 129,
 * target 116) — but it gets there by emitting sb=12 / sh=12 against the
 * target's 13/11, i.e. it dropped a byte store and widened another. That is
 * semantically WRONG and was rejected. This is the expected outcome: the
 * permuter reshapes C, and every reshape still leaves &D_000A3F0C a
 * compile-time constant for the propagation pass to fold, so it cannot reach
 * the cached-base form. Do not re-run it on this function without first
 * changing something that denies the compiler that constant. The scaffold is
 * reusable for other functions (base.c / target.o / compile.sh / settings.toml;
 * note GNU `as` cannot assemble the Allegrex min/max, so target.o must emit
 * those two as .word).
 *
 * The form committed here re-materialises addresses and is 13 words over, but
 * it is CORRECT — it writes every field. Do not trade that away for a smaller
 * word count: an object missing four field writes is a worse result than a
 * NONMATCHING draft.
 *
 * ALSO ESTABLISHED (reusable): +0xCC is a BITFIELD. The target truncates the
 * source value once (`andi $a2,$zero,1`) then per field does
 * lbu / mask / shift / `or` / sb — MWCC's bitfield-insert idiom, which
 * cannot come from `(b & ~N) | (flag << k)` because MWCC folds the `or` away
 * once it sees flag == 0 (~3 words lost per field). A struct of
 * `unsigned char x : 1` fields reproduces them. Do NOT also model +0xCD as a
 * bitfield in the same struct: MWCC then merges the 0xCD insert into the
 * preceding 0xCC one and stores the result to the WRONG byte (verified in
 * isolation). +0xCD and +0xD6 take nonzero constants, so plain masking is
 * correct for them. */

 *
 * Behaviour:

 *     one byte per halfword, NUL-terminated — a hand-rolled widening loop,
 *     not a library call;
 *   - it then sets the text colour/style (ehsys_942B03D0 / ehsys_60B55A50
 *     with 0xFF000000) and hands the widened label to func_00000894, which

 *   - arg2/arg3 are the row's x/y, both offset by +2 before drawing.
 *
 * MATCHING NOTES:
 *  - the copy loop is written test-first with explicit `goto`s to reproduce
 *    the target's bottom-tested layout;
 *  - arg0 looked unused and had been typed that way, which was WRONG and cost
 *    a lot of time. It IS forwarded as the first argument of ehsys_CABEA834:
 *    the target never writes $a0 before that jal and sets only $a1 = -1 in
 *    its delay slot. Because $a0 is therefore live, it is unavailable for the
 *    copy-loop pointer, which is why the target keeps that pointer in $a1 —
